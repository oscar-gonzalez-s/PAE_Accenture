Purpose: 
  The purpose of this file is to provide the utilities
  for editing the score associated to each instagrammer. 
  Functions may display a broader explanation of their functionalities 
  before their description, this may be useful to fill documentation
  and overall system integration. A more usage-oriented description is
  provided inside each function.

  confidenceEditor(filename, success_rate, influencer_name) 
Receives:
  - .csv file containing 3 columns: instagrammer name, instagrammer gender, instagrammer score. 
  - Instagrammer name (the instagrammer that was published that week as the trend predictor)
  - Percentage of success (can be positive or negative, will be computed comparing the 
    interaction success of the post in the telegram channel with the medium interaction 
    value of the telegram channel)
Returns:
  - Modified .csv.

Assumptions:
  - Instagrammers won't change in the initial programm. 
  - Scores are initialized to a 0.5 value 

Possible improvements to this function: 
  - See if there's a new instagrammer, if so, add it to the list.
  - Receive two percentages, one from telegram (already implemented), 
    and another from data processing predictions from the next weeks,
    ensuring if the item selected as trend has experienced an increase
    in #times emergence (meaning success in trend prediction).

Assumptions: 
  - Information received in the .json file must have not been received before.

  - Following bullet one, this function will be called with the same periodicity 
    as telegram posts are posted. 
    
Possible improvements to this function:
  - For now, mean engagement is calculated with both women and men posts. Possible
    improvement could include calculating mean engagement for women's and men's
    posts separately.
