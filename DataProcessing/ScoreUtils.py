Purpose: 
  The purpose of this file is to provide the utilities
  for editing the score associated to each instagrammer. 
  Functions may display a broader explanation of their functionalities 
  before their description, this may be useful to fill documentation
  and overall system integration. A more usage-oriented description is
  provided inside each function.

Possible improvements to this function:

  - Receive two percentages, one from telegram (already implemented), 
    and another from data processing predictions from the next weeks,

    in #times emergence (meaning success in trend prediction).

    improvement could include calculating mean engagement for women's and men's
    posts separately.
